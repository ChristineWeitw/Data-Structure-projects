# Data-Structure-projects
Projects that apply different data structures to solve complex problems.
## Stack.ipynb 
In this project, we use stacks to implement an algorithm that can evaluate numerical expressions.
Oftentimes, when we write an expression, we use infix notation, meaning that we put the operators between the two operands. For example 1 + 2 is in infix notation because the + operator is between the operands 1 and 2.
For a computer, it's much easier to evaluate an expression written in postfix notation. In postfix notation, the operands appear before the operator. The infix expression 1 + 2 becomes 1 2 + in postfix notation.
